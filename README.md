# Phoenix Engine

The engine aims for faster 2D rendering using OpenGL with Glfw library.

This engine is inspired by TheCherno's Hazel Engine. The engine uses extensive and core MS Visual C++.

I'll add OpenGL implementations soon. The engine is infant at this stage.

Click on `Generate.bat` file to create a MSVS Solution in the main directory.

You can access the engine with Microsoft&copy; [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

The developers using the engine must include the engine's logo in their projects.

The engine is more or less a code along of the game engine series of TheCherno.
